# Analysis pipelines for the sing-cell transcriptomic of sheep ovarian
### **1. Introduction**
In this study, we profiled 61,649 single-cell transcriptomes from sheep ovarian tissues, spanning prenatal (E90), pre-puberty (M3), post-puberty (M6), and adulthood (Y2, Y4) stages.
### **2. Analysis pipeline**
Raw sequencing data processing, quality control and cell clustering
